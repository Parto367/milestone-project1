<H1>ST HELENS EXTENDED HOURS SERVICE</H1>
<p>The GP extended service has been sent up several years ago and had an Out of Hours service running from this centre.
  The service also had several Gp’s that could be sent out to visit patients at home.  
  This service had been running very well, however then Covid 19 struck and this service had to get bigger and better to help with the new constraints on seeing patients Face to face. 
   This website is to help you as patients get the help that you need at the right time in the right place.  </p>
